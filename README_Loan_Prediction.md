# Loan Prediction & Python Assessment Project (April 2025)

This repository contains a Python assessment completed as part of the Big Data Analytics programme. The notebook demonstrates real-world applications of data analysis, data visualization, and machine learning using a loan dataset.

## ✅ Project Overview
The project includes various Python exercises and a final predictive modeling task using Linear Regression. It walks through the full data science workflow from data cleaning to evaluation.

## 🧠 Tasks Covered
1. **Python Practice Tasks**:
   - Count digits in a number
   - Palindrome checker
   - Nested loops to generate patterns

2. **Data Handling with Pandas**:
   - Importing and inspecting the dataset
   - Cleaning null values
   - Checking data types and fixing inconsistencies

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**:
   - Descriptive statistics
   - Value counts and filtering
   - Correlation matrix

4. **Data Visualization**:
   - Seaborn regression plots
   - Residual distribution (distplot)
   - Line plots for predicted vs actual values

5. **Machine Learning**:
   - Feature selection
   - Linear Regression using `scikit-learn`
   - Train/test split
   - Model performance using R-squared score

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- scikit-learn
